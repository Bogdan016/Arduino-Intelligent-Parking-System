## About The Project

<div align="center">
  
  ![Display Image](images/ProjectDemo.gif)

</div>

  This project is dedicated to the development of a reverse parking assistance system, designed to simplify the parking process by using Arduino technology combined with ultrasonic sensors. 
It accurately measures and displays the distance to obstacles located behind the vehicle, enhancing safety and efficiency for drivers.

Technical Details:

* Microcontroller: Arduino Uno is used as the control unit for processing sensor data and managing the display output.
* Sensors: Three ultrasonic sensors provide spatial data by detecting objects in the vehicle’s path. The distances measured by these sensors are used to determine proximity to obstacles.
* Display: An OLED display presents real-time information in a user-friendly format, including a graphical representation of a car, distance measurements in units, and sound status indicators.
* Auditory Feedback: A buzzer system is integrated to offer auditory alerts. These alerts vary in frequency based on the proximity to obstacles, with the ability to toggle the sound on or off via a user-controlled button.
