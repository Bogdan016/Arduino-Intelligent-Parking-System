## Introduction
This project involves the development of a reverse parking assistance system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. 
The system aims to measure and display the distance to obstacles behind the vehicle, assisting drivers during the parking process.


## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- OLED Display
- Buzzer
- *(Add any other components used)*

## Circuit Diagram
*(Insert a picture of the circuit diagram. This will help others understand how to connect the components. You can create the circuit diagram using any electronics design software.)*

## Code Explanation
*(Explain the Arduino code used in this project. Break down the code into smaller parts and explain each part.)*

### Setup
*(Explain the `setup()` function. Discuss how it initializes the pins for each sensor and sets up the positions for the labels on the OLED display.)*

### Loop
*(Explain the `loop()` function. Discuss how it reads from the sensors, updates the OLED display, and sounds the buzzer based on the measured distances.)*

### Display Update
*(Explain the part of the code that handles the drawing on the OLED display. Discuss how it creates a dynamic display that updates based on the readings from the sensors.)*

## Results and Observations
*(Discuss the results you obtained from this project. Share your observations and any challenges you faced. Insert pictures or videos of the project in action.)*

## Conclusion
*(Summarize the project, its results, and its applications. Discuss any potential improvements or modifications.)*





## Application Domain

This solution can be used in the automotive domain, especially for larger vehicles or for drivers who want additional assistance during reverse parking maneuvers. 
It's suitable for cars, small trucks, caravans, or similar vehicles.

## Advantages

- **Cost Savings**: The proposed system uses affordable electronic components, making it much more cost-effective than integrated parking assistance solutions offered by car manufacturers.
- **Precise Measurements**: Systems based on ultrasonic sensors provide precise distance measurements, helping drivers avoid collisions during parking maneuvers.
