## Introduction
This project involves the development of a reverse parking assistance system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. 
The system aims to measure and display the distance to obstacles behind the vehicle, assisting drivers during the parking process.

## Description
In my project, I use an OLED display and three ultrasonic sensors to measure distances. 
The display shows a car image, unit indicator, sound indicators, and sensor readings. 
Iâ€™ve also included a buzzer that provides auditory feedback based on the measured distances. 
I can toggle the sound on and off using a button. The code for my project is well-structured and organized, making it easy for me to manage and update.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- OLED Display
- Buzzer
- Button

## Conclusion and personal observations

This project was the first arduino project i worked on. 
I had fun and ocassional frustration, I learned a lot about hardware, arduino and sensors. 
I also presented the project for one of my uni class so i had an ideea to add a lego "car" to make it more visually appealing.

Also i really wanted to share this design i created:
