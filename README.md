# Parking Assistance System with Sensors and Arduino

## Description

This project involves the development of a reverse parking assistance system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. 
The system aims to measure and display the distance to obstacles behind the vehicle, assisting drivers during the parking process.

## Components

- Arduino
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- OLED Screen
- Buzzer

## Application Domain

This solution can be used in the automotive domain, especially for larger vehicles or for drivers who want additional assistance during reverse parking maneuvers. 
It's suitable for cars, small trucks, caravans, or similar vehicles.

## Advantages

- **Cost Savings**: The proposed system uses affordable electronic components, making it much more cost-effective than integrated parking assistance solutions offered by car manufacturers.
- **Precise Measurements**: Systems based on ultrasonic sensors provide precise distance measurements, helping drivers avoid collisions during parking maneuvers.
